# What is the importance of blockchain ?
Decentralization : There's not a single stand alone central authority . All the control ,  decision making power over the blockchain is given to its participants in the network. 
The copy of the blockchain network is stored on all the participant's computer.

Transparency : In blockchain there's public ledger . These records or block are connected to each other and are publicly available in that blockchain network . All the records can be trace back to the initial record. Therefore, any participant (if want) can view all the record.

Immutable :  The ledger mentioned above is also immutable. Once the record had been created and pushed to the network . It is practically impossible to change it's data (It requires immense amount of computing power ) . 
# Explain different types of consensus mechanisms
Consensus Mechanism :
	It defines how new block must be added to the network.
	
POW (Proof Of Work) : In this the miners , verify the block by using their computing power to get the hash of new block which must be smaller than the hash given by the network. The first miner which achieves this gets to add new block also get block reward and transaction fees. Bitcoin uses POW.

POS (Proof Of Stake) : In this the validators locks up (stake) their certain amount of crypto currencies in the smart contract of the blockchain.The more they stake , blockchain algorithm sets them more probable to give verification job.If the validators does some shady thing then all the crypto they stake will be burned. So, the validators have motivation to do validation faithfully. Ethereum uses POS.
